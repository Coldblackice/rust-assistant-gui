# Rust Assistant

Unofficial Assistant for the game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/) to help players improve their gameplay without breaking the game.
The tool displays combat logs in a user-friendly interface with visual aids, making it faster and easier to understand each combat log. It replicates the in-game "combatlog" command's format while providing enhanced usability. The tool updates in real-time as soon as the user initiates the "combatlog" command in game.
